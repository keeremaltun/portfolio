# Kerem Altun - Personal Portfolio Website

Hello! This repository contains my personal portfolio website and some of the projects I've developed as part of my Software Engineering education at Gisma University.

## My Projects

* **Motivation App (Python):** A simple Python application that provides daily motivational messages to users. This project aims to demonstrate my foundational skills in Python programming, file I/O, and basic user interaction.

* **Personal Web Portfolio (HTML/CSS):** This is the very website you're viewing! It was designed and coded by me from scratch using HTML and CSS. Its purpose is to showcase my web development skills and completed projects, hosted on GitHub Pages.
